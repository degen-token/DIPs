## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard interface and API to enable the risk-free consumption of paid content.

## Motivation

Creators want to get paid for their work but consumers don't want to use microtransactions for fear of paying for substandard content or spam. DEGEN can facilitate these interactions with novel incentive mechanisms.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Creating the Frame

A creator should upload content to a frame or other client and post an initial price to view the content in DEGEN. The creator must deposit this initial price to an escrow smart contract and select an expiry date, and then the frame will be shareable by the creator.

If the content includes a steganographically encoded message signed by the frame deployer, then the frame should keep the creator's deposit and show an error message informing the creator that the content is stolen. If someone's public key or fid is in the signed message, they should be banned from viewing future content through the frame.

### Viewing the Frame

A consumer interacting with the framed content for the first time will see an obscured or garbled image with a "Pay to View" button or similar. By clicking the button, they will pay the creator's initial price in DEGEN.

Once the price has been paid, the content will be revealed to the consumer and the interface will show 4 options. The content file should have a signed message steganographically encoded into the content and paired with the consumer's unique identity or wallet on the messaging protocol. This could be a signed message including the consumer's public key, a fid, or similar.

The 4 options are as follows:
  1. Recast
  1. Refund
  1. Remix
  1. Report

If the consumer selects recast or exits the frame, the creator receives the payment less a transaction fee shared between DEGEN and the frame maintainer.

If the consumer selects refund, their address is placed into a `dissatisfied` field until the next consumer asks for a refund or the frame expires. The DEGEN paid by the consumer to view the frame goes into an escrow staging field until the next consumer asks for a refund.

If the consumer selects remix, they may quote cast the original content and upload their own content to a new frame with a new price.

If the consumer selects report, they may upload a piece of content to the frame to see if it has been stolen. If the frame recognizes the steganographically signed message, then the frame can ban the consumer identified in the signed message from viewing future frames.

### The Escrow Contract

Every DRC-0005 compliant allowance contract MUST implement the DRC-0005 interfaces (subject to the "caveats", below):
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

/// @title DRC-0005 Content Escrow Contract Standard
/// @dev See https://dips.degen.tips/DIPS/dip-0002
interface DRC0005 {
  /// @notice Returns the designated recipient of tips on behalf
  ///  of the DEGEN protocol
  /// @dev This address has update permissions on the collector
  ///  as well as the maintainer
  function collector() public view returns (address);

  /// @notice Returns the contract maintainer
  /// @dev The maintainer can be updated by the collector
  function maintainer() public view returns (address);

  /// @notice Adds funds to the escrow
  function create(uint256 _amount) external;

  /// @notice Adds funds to the escrow staging
  /// @dev Must be equal to the escrow
  function reveal(uint256 _amount) external;

  /// @notice Moves the amount in excrow from escrow staging
  ///  to claimable
  function release(uint256 _amount) external;

  /// @notice Refunds the escrow staging amount to dissatisfied
  ///  and overwrites the address with msg.sender
  /// @dev If dissatisfied is empty, escrow staging is  empty
  ///  and the function merely puts msg.sender in dissatisfied
  function refund() external;

  /// @notice Claims the funds on behalf of the creator,
  ///  closes the frame to future viewers, and refunds the
  ///  last remaining consumer in the dissatisfied field
  ///  from the escrow amount. If no user asked for a
  ///  a refund, then the escrow is returned to the creator
  function claim() external;
}
