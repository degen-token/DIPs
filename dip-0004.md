## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard interface and API to discover the engagement metrics and audience profile of an arbitrary account on any messaging protocol, examine their overlap with your own audience, and offer them and their audience a bounty to amplify your content.

## Motivation

The success of DEGEN raindrops on Farcaster has shown latent demand for a native peer-to-peer advertising medium where consumers can get paid directly to interact with paid content, and where creators and curators can get paid to amplify that content to their audience. Curators want additional information about the amplifiers' audiences before paying and amplifiers want creative control over the end content being shared.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### The Marketplace

A curator should be able to look up an arbitrary account on any messaging protocol and see their engagement metrics alongside the disjoint set of accounts that follow this creator but that do not follow or interact with the curator.

A curator should be able to offer any creator a bounty denominated in DEGEN that includes a raindrop to the creator's consumers and a sample piece of content for the creator to share. Any funds from the bounty that are not included in the raindrop should be sent to the creator upon completion.

The creator should be able to accept or deny the curator's offer and edit any content before posting to the messaging protocol.

The creator and curator must both confirm before the final content is posted.

### The Bounty

Once the creator has posted content approved by the curator, the curator should distribute a pro rata portion of the raindrop to any comments on the parent post which the curator gives a like, or other similar action indicating approval. This action should be a first-class citizen on the host messaging protocol.
