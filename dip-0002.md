## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for token deployers and community members to convert their token into a tippable token. This standard provides basic functionality to reserve a namespace, deposit tokens to an allowance contract associated with one or more namespaces, allocate a percentage of the deposited tokens to an allowlist of addresses according to a vesting schedule, deploy an automation to ingest messages from an arbitrary messaging service and extract tips in the designated namespace, check tip messages against the allowlisted allocations, and distribute valid tips to designated recipients.

## Motivation

Tipping is an incredibly effective fair launch primitive, where initial community members get to select who is deserving of joining the community, and new community members can quickly build a position in the community's token by contributing value back to the community. Launching a tipping token is non-trivial, and the complexity should be abstracted away in order to make tipping tokens more accessible as a distribution mechanism and a medium for continued community engagement.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Namespace ERC721

Every DRC-0002 compliant namespace contract must implement the ERC721 and ERC165 interfaces.

#### Additional Methods

##### domain

Returns the namespace used for tipping - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

``` js
function domain() public view returns (string)
```

##### tippableToken

Returns the network and contract to be used for tipping - e.g. `"base:0x4ed4E862860beD51a9570b96d89aF5E1B0Efefed"`.

``` js
function tippableToken() public view returns (string)
```

### Allowance Contract

Every DRC-0002 compliant allowance contract MUST implement the DRC-0002 interfaces (subject to the "caveats", below):
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

/// @title DRC-0002 Allowance Contract Standard
/// @dev See https://dips.degen.tips/DIPS/dip-0002
interface DRC0002 {
  /// @notice Returns the designated recipient of tips on behalf
  ///  of the DEGEN protocol
  /// @dev This address has update permissions on the collector
  ///  as well as the maintainer
  function collector() public view returns (address);

  /// @notice Returns the contract maintainer
  /// @dev The maintainer can be updated by the collector
  function maintainer() public view returns (address);

  /// @notice Distribute tips to all valid receivers
  /// @dev Should include a call to any extensions required by
  ///  the deployer before distributing the tips, in which case
  ///  calldata may be empty. Collector and maintainer both
  ///  receive a percentage of all tips
  /// @param _receivers An array of addresses to receive tips
  /// @param _amounts An array of amounts to be transferred
  ///  corresponding by index to the receivers 
  function distribute(address[] calldata _receivers, uint256[] calldata _amounts) external;
}
```

### Vault Contract Extension

The vault contract extension is OPTIONAL for DRC-0002 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This allows your allowance contract to rely on a vault to determine the allocation and vesting schedule for depositors to the vault.

### Onchain Data Availability Extension

The onchain data availability contract extension is OPTIONAL for DRC-0002 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This allows your allowance contract to rely on an onchain source of data to determine the validity of tips for distribution.

### Moderation Extension

The moderation extension is OPTIONAL for DRC-0002 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This enables your allowance contract to delay delivery of tips up to n epochs or blocks so deployers have a chance to invalidate suspicious tips.

### Multichain Extension

The multichain extension is OPTIONAL for DRC-0002 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This enables subdomains on the namespace contract to select the preferred chain on which to receive tips.
