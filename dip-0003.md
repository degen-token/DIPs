## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard onboarding message and set of transactions to educate users of arbitrary messaging protocols on the usage and acquisition of DEGEN.

## Motivation

Tipping is not a first-class citizen of host messaging protocols, and so there is no guarantee that the messaging platform will educate new users on how to receive and give DEGEN tips. This DIP aims to provide a protocol agnostic method for onboarding new users to the tipping game using the underlying protocol's normal messaging layer.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Protocols With Wallet Support

For messaging protocols that support a native wallet such as Farcaster, XMTP, Lens, or others, the bot should recognize when a new account has been created, identify the wallet that has been created for that account, and immediately deposit a de minimis amount of DEGEN to the wallet, eg 100 DEGEN. This amount must not exceed the amount required to open the account.

### Messaging Protocol Account

The bot account that tips the new account should welcome the new user in a parent message and use a native primitive to describe the DEGEN tipping game and how to get a larger allowance in a child message.

As an example, on Farcaster, the bot should quote cast another thread that describes how to give tips, how to earn tips, how to increase your allowance, and how to use DEGEN L3 alongside ecosystem projects such as DegenPad, ITAP, POIDH, or microsub.
