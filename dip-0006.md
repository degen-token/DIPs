## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard interface and API to enable a permissionless token launcher designed for the Farcaster community, ensuring fair launches, anti-sniping protections, and built-in tipping as a core feature. The system is built on the DEGEN chain, leveraging its low fees and speed for seamless tipping and transactions.

## Motivation

Launchpads are a major component of the cryptocurrency industry generating a significant share of revenues among consumer-facing decentralized applications. These launchpads are plagued by various adverse incentives that draw malicious actors to pump and dump tokens on retail consumers who are looking for a quick 1000x jackpot. There should exist a launchpad that aligns incentives of token launchers and token holders to create lasting community tokens with long-term upside and utility.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Fair Launch & Anti-Sniping

- Whitelisted Launch: Only Farcaster wallets can buy within the first 24 hours to prevent sniping. Stretch goal: whitelist by ownership of an existing NFT or a certain token amount, e.g. must own 1 Degentlemen or 10,000 DEGEN.
- Open Access After 24 Hours: Liquidity pool (LP) becomes accessible to all participants.
- Goal: Ensure early access for community members before broader exposure while preventing bot-driven sniping.

### Token Launch Permissions

- Open to all users – Anyone can launch a token.
- No ranking filters (unlike Clanker, which restricts launches to select accounts).
- Security focus: Instead of gatekeeping, we design rug-resistant tokenomics that ensure sustainability and prevent abuse.

### Tokenomics Model

#### Token Standard

- Standard ERC-20
- Potential Extensions:
  - ERC20Burnable – Enables deflationary mechanics.
  - ERC20Permit – Allows gasless approvals for smoother transactions.
  - ERC20Votes (if applicable) – Enables on-chain governance if governance is introduced later.

#### Supply Allocation

- 25% to Liquidity Pool (LP)
  - Paired with DEGEN to align with the broader ecosystem.
  - LP NFT is controlled by us to ensure stability and prevent liquidity drains.
- 25% to Founder
  - Vested with a 6-month cliff and 4-year vesting schedule.
  - Ensures founders have long-term incentives while preventing early dumps.
- 50% for Built-in Tipping
  - Used to reward engagement and community activity.
  - Tipping Time Horizon: A 4-year structured distribution to ensure long-term sustainability.
  - Tipping Allowance Based on Token Holdings:
    - The more tokens a user owns, the more tipping power they have.
    - Example: A user holding 1% of the total supply might be able to distribute 1% daily tipping pool.
- Goal: Encourage organic community engagement and long-term alignment.

#### LP Fees

- 20% transaction fee (compared to Clanker’s 60%).
- Goal: Ensure fees cover gas costs, infrastructure, and ecosystem sustainability.

### Liquidity Management

- DEGEN will control the LP NFT, ensuring the liquidity pool remains stable, only to prevent rug-pull risks. LP fees should go back to the creators, though DEGEN may take a small operational cut no greater than 5%. DEGEN securely manage LP tokens and transparently distribute accrued fees.
- This prevents instant liquidity drains while still allowing trading after the 24-hour Farcaster-exclusive period.

### Built-in Tipping System (Powered by DEGEN Chain)

This section can optionally draw on DIP-0002 to power the tipping of Memestack tokens.
- Tipping is a native feature in every launched token.
- Built on the DEGEN chain to enable fast, low-cost transactions without relying on more expensive Base gas fees.
- Tipping Time Horizon:
  - 50% of total supply is allocated to tipping, distributed over 4 years.
  - Ensures long-term sustainability and consistent engagement.
- Tipping Allowance Mechanics:
  - Based on token holdings: Users with more tokens have higher tipping power.
  - Encourages holders to support community engagement rather than immediately dumping tokens.
- Goal: Incentivize active participation and long-term alignment with each token's community.

#### Future Enhancements (Post-V1)
- Introduce staking-based tipping multipliers.
- Consider additional governance mechanisms using ERC20Votes if needed.

## Rationale

### Why Build on DEGEN Chain?
- Optimized for tipping & microtransactions – Low fees + high speed.
- Aligned with DEGEN ecosystem – Strengthens on-chain engagement and network effects
- Built-in social layer – Enhances adoption and utility of tokens within Farcaster-native communities.
